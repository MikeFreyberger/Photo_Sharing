Photo_Sharing
=============
This is code for an MVC controller, intended to be used inside of a CodeIgniter Framework. When this controller is triggered, an email account that you enter will be scanned for new emails with photo attachments. If there are new photos in the email account, these photos will then be added to that Google Plus Account. This controller is intended to be ran on the server level through the use of a cron job so users can send photos in to your company wide email account, and then those photos will be hosted on Google's Photo Servers.
